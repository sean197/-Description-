Simulated attack detection using Microsoft Sentinel, Defender for Endpoint, and KQL. Incident triggered and detected from custom PowerShell persistence script.

Microsoft Sentinel Threat Detection Lab ðŸš¨
Overview
Simulated a real-world attack using obfuscated PowerShell persistence. Detected it with a custom KQL rule in Microsoft Sentinel, triggered an incident in Defender for Endpoint, and validated full alert â†’ incident flow.

Key Tools
Microsoft Sentinel
Defender for Endpoint (P2)
Azure VM (Windows 11)
KQL (Log & Hunting)
MITRE ATT&CK Mapping


Attack Script (Simulated Persistence)

Set-MpPreference -DisableRealtimeMonitoring $true

$registryPath = "HKCU:\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run"
Set-ItemProperty -Path $registryPath -Name "Updater" `
-Value "powershell.exe -w hidden -enc UwB0AGEAcgB0AC0AUwBsAGUAZQBwACAAMQA=" -Force

Start-Process powershell.exe -ArgumentList "-w hidden -enc UwB0AGEAcgB0AC0AUwBsAGUAZQBwACAAMQA="

Set-MpPreference -DisableRealtimeMonitoring $false


Detection Query (KQL)
DeviceProcessEvents
| where FileName == "powershell.exe"
| where ProcessCommandLine contains "Start-Sleep" and ProcessCommandLine contains "-enc"
| sort by Timestamp desc

MITRE ATT&CK Mapping
Execution â†’ T1059.001 (PowerShell)
Persistence â†’ T1547 (Registry Run Keys)

Outcome

Alert fired in Defender
Attack linked to specific VM
Detection rule ran every 5 minutes
Full visibility, traceability, and response workflow achieved
